# MachineLearningExercises
Machine Learning exercises and sample projects using Python

I have worked through the book "Essential Math for Data Science: Take Control of Your Data with Fundamental Linear Algebra, Probability, and Statistics" by Thomas Nield:

I then completed the Applied Data Science Lab certificate program (approx. 150 hours) offered by WorldQuant University. This involved hands-on practice, using Python and Jupyter notebooks, on a range of projects that each involved data cleaning and preparation, choosing and training a machine learning model, and interpreting and visualizing data. The last two modules involved building interactive dashboards.

I am now working through the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems" (3rd Edition) by Aurélien Géron:

## Local environment setup

* Python 3
* Anaconda needs to be installed to provide access to SymPy, NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, Jupyter, etc.
* I'm currently using VSCode as the IDE; be sure to install the Python and Pylance extensions
