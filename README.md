Machine Learning exercises and sample projects using Python

I have worked through the book "Essential Math for Data Science: Take Control of Your Data with Fundamental Linear Algebra, Probability, and Statistics" by Thomas Nield:

## Environment setup

* Python 3
* Anaconda needs to be installed to provide access to SymPy, NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, Jupyter, etc.
* I'm currently using VSCode as the IDE; be sure to install the Python and Pylance extensions
